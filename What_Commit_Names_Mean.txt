Commit other files 1 = 1st attempt to commit the rest of the lab files to Github
Testing Commit = Testing to see if a photo can be commited to Github


Please do not doc points for me, I made changes to some commits, I did not want to create this lab from scratch again. I added more commits that are not just commit 1, 2, etc. 

I did not change these commits because I feel I would have to redo the whole repository to make the changes
